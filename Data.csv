;The private equity firm is seeding Virescent Infrastructure with five solar assets it acquired earlier this year from an Indian developer.
;TPG Capital agreed to sell the US company Astound Broadband to Stonepeak and a management business called Patriot Media.
;The ASX-listed firm is shifting attention to the US, where 14 of its 16 assets are located, to simplify its business and avoid Australian regulatory uncertainty.
;The I Squared-backed company will invest an additional $95m in the assets over the course of the 30-year concession it was awarded.
;After years of delays and recent months of legal wrangling, the private consortium selected to develop the $5.6bn light-rail project is walking away.
;First Sentier’s Danny Latham said that investors are increasingly focused on ‘utility-style’ assets and that the firm has been pursuing Australian renewables for some time.
;The Australian fund manager has taken a 75% stake in a new renewables platform alongside Engie and Mitsui, with 1.3GW of development assets in its pipeline.
;The A$125bn superfund is trying to take fibre provider OptiComm private in a A$675m deal that follows three infrastructure investing themes quite closely.
;The deal is the second investment for BlackRock’s Global Renewable Power III following a commitment to Belgian renewable developer Windvision in September.
;The first transaction comes in the form of a A$130m senior syndicated loan facility, with capital funded via a separate account.
;The new platform, which builds on IFM and Trafigura’s existing Impala Terminals business, could deploy $2bn in renewable energy generation.
;The acquisition of the 15.3km toll road includes a minimum guarantee cash yield for MIRA’s listed fund for the remaining 27-year concession term.
;The UK-based firm will fund the investment through one of its Asia real estate funds.
;The fibre company has a growing presence in Europe and is also the largest active operator in South Africa.
;The portfolio comprises six projects developed by Macquarie’s renewable energy platform Acacia.
;The deal to develop and maintain 10 battery systems also marks the French firm’s first infrastructure investment in Canada.
;The firm has taken a ‘sizeable minority position’ in UK-based Connexin and could use it as a platform for further growth in this sector.
;GIG will invest around $11.6bn in the five projects, with the majority of funds coming from Korean institutional investors.
;The conglomerate, which bid $843m for EMC Holdings, beat Goldman Sachs and Keppel Infra, with a view to improving sustainability of its own operations.
